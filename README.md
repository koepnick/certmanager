# certmanager
A (very) simple frontend for managing internal TLS/SSL certificates

## Basics

Thanks to the tireless efforts of the EFF and LetsEncrypt, the need for centrally managed certificates are not as necessary as they once were. But, for one reason or another sometimes an internal organization needs to be able to issue certificates that have not been signed by one of the major issuers.
